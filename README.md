### In this Power BI report, I made several key improvisations to enhance clarity and presentation. 
###📝 Added a header titled "Week 1 Task" using a text box and a background shape to give the dashboard a professional and structured look. 
###✨ I visualized the sum of production by state using both bar and pie charts for better comparative analysis. 
###⭐ Additionally, I included a pie chart to represent the distribution of crops by season, making it easier to understand seasonal trends.
